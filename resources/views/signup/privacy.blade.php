	<ul>

	    <li>In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information such as your IP addresses, user device information and your geographical location. We tie your IP address to your personally identifiable information. </li>
	    <li>  When you send SMS or publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of karibuSMS, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture). We may also collect other users' comments about you.<br/></li>
	    <li> We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use our service to post solicited materials and inconsistence contents that might harm other people or build a sense of insecurity</li>
	    <li>
		When you delete IP content (intellectual property content), it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others)
